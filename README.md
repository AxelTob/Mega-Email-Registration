# Mega-Email-Registration
Testing whether or not an email is registered on the website. Multithreaded application.

Short application, not that beautifully written. Mostly just experimenting with different Python multithread implementations, testing their different execution time and if the problem would occur sharing the same output file.

Using concurrent.futures for dealing with the I/O heavy scraping and submitting results to a seperate Writing Thread queue, they'll write to same output file.

++ The app ++
Checks whether an email is registered to the website (mega) or not, mostly just experimenting with multithreading and scraping is a quite I/O heavy task. Could have various use-cases.

Also I do not endorse web scraping with any commericial interest in mind, without consulting,
  nor do I suggest that building a database of publicy available data is legally/morally justifiable.
