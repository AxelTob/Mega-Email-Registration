# Mega-Email-Registration
Testing whether or not an email is registered on the website. Multithreaded application.

Short application, not that beautifully written. Mostly just experimenting with different Python multithread implementations, testing their different execution time and if the problem would occur sharing the same output file.

With the solutions, I settle with I don't believe locks are necessary - although generally a good practical rule for shared data. 

The app --
Checks whether an email is registered to the website, these applications can be ex. test customer behaviors, username availability, filter email lists .. 
Mostly just used to experimenting.
Implemented using requests and concurrent.futures

To MEGA - if for any reason you would want repo removed, let me know :)
